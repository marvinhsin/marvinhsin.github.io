                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> The website displays  many good inspirational designs regarding to 
                                UI. It makes me realize that a good UI design really makes people want
                                 to stay longer on the product. The animations are cool.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favororite part is the scrolling animation of the credit 
                                cards. It is unbelievable that this tiny detailed design makes 
                             the UX so comforting. It's like ASMR. They are as simple as you would
                              think this is dumb, but somehow very soothing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think this question is essentially the same as precious one, so I will 
                                share the other design that I like. I like the crypto app has a little animation 
                            playing as sending a payment. This adds the loading page a sense of technology while 
                        aligning with what crpto is. </p>

                            <p> 9. They display many design and they are all very inspirational. I enjoyed it. </p>
