					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that we can take advantage of our brain's magical function 
								to create UI designs that are more user friendly. For example, the 
							proximity actually hints our brain to deem closer items a group.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the part that it introduces emergence. The dog is easily identified
								 by our brain, but it is just some spots arrangement. This somehow makes me 
								feel cool about my brain. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations? How does their mind react to the message your piece is sharing?” </p>
						</li>
