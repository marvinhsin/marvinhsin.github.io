    <p><em>Computer Science Major | Senior</em></p>


    <p>Hi! My name is Marvin and I am a CS senior at Cal. Recently, 
        I've been actively searching for jobs. I think that it is a good
        chance to learn how to build up a website for my career portfolio. 
        That's why I am here. Nice to meet you all!</p>

    <h2>My Responses to the Article:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned that I should pay more attention on the layout and design under the hood of the daily using apps. I can 
            benefit from people's aesthetic and also learn to think the architectures as a front-end designer.

        <li>My favorite part is watching the author breakes down Spotify, Twitters, etc using GIF. They help me deconstruct 
            the user interface vividly.
